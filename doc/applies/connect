NAME
       connect - returns a pointer to the user (player) object to
       the driver

SYNOPSIS
       object connect( void );

DESCRIPTION
       The driver calls connect() in the master object whenever a
       new  user  logs  into  the driver.  The object returned by
       connect() is used as the initial user object.   Note  that
       it  is  possible to use exec(3) to switch the user connec-
       tion from the initial user object to some other object.
