NAME
       call_out() - delayed function call in same object

SYNOPSIS
       void call_out( string fun, int delay, mixed arg );

DESCRIPTION
       Set up a call of function <fun> in this_object(). The call
       will take place in  <delay>  seconds,  with  the  argument
       <arg> provided. <arg> can be of any type.
