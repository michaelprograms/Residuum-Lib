swap(3)               LPC Library Functions               swap(3)

NAME
       swap - swap out a file explicitly

SYNOPSIS
       void swap( object );

DESCRIPTION
       This  efun  should  be  reserved  for  debugging only.  It
       allows  an  object  to  be  explicitly  swapped  out.   If
       enabled,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that a simul_efun
       override (for this efun) be used to prevent abuse.

       Note: objects which have been destructed, already  swapped
       out,  contain a heart beat, cloned, inherited, or interac-
       tive, cannot be swapped out.
