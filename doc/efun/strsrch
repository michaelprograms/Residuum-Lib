NAME
       strsrch() - search for substrings in a string

SYNOPSIS
       int strsrch( string str, string substr | int char,
                    int flag );

DESCRIPTION
       strsrch()  searches  for the first occurance of the string
       `substr' in the string `str'.  The last occurance of `sub-
       str'  can  be  found  by  passing `-1' as the 3rd argument
       (which is optional).  If the second argument is  an  inte-
       ger,    that    character    is    found    (a    la   C's
       strchr()/strrchr().)  The empty string or null value  can-
       not be searched for.

RETURN VALUE
       The  integer offset of the first (last) match is returned.
       -1 is returned if there was no match, or an error occurred
       (bad args, etc).
