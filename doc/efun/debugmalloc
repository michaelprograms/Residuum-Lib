NAME
       debugmalloc()  - dumps information on malloc'd memory to a
       file.

SYNOPSIS
       void debugmalloc( string filename, int mask );

DESCRIPTION
       This efun is only available when DEBUGMALLOC and DEBUGMAL-
       LOC_EXTENSIONS  are  both  defined  in options.h at driver
       build time.  The debugmalloc() efun will dump  information
       on  those  chunks  of  memory  allocated  by DMALLOC() and
       related macros if the mask bitwise and'd (&) with the  tag
       supplied  by  the  macro  (i.e. (mask & tag)) is non-zero.
       Read md.c and config.h  in  the  driver  source  for  more
       information.
