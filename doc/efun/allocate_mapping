NAME
       allocate_mapping() - pre-allocate space for a mapping

SYNOPSIS
       mapping allocate_mapping( int size );

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a mapping with space for 'size' elements preallo-
       cated.

       For example:

              mapping x;
              int y = 200;

              x = allocate_mapping(y);

       where y is the initial size of the mapping.   Using  allo-
       cate_mapping is the preferred way to initalize the mapping
       if you have some idea of how many elements  the  map  will
       contain (200 in this case).  The reason is that allocating
       storage all at once is  slightly  more  memory  efficient.
       Thus  if  you  are using mappings to store a soul with 200
       entries, the above initialization would be quite appropri-
       ate.    Note,  that  the  above  initialization  does  not
       restrict you to 200 entries.  It just that the  first  200
       entries  will  be  stored  more efficiently.  Note: if you
       will be deleting  many  elements  from  the  mapping,  you
       should  use x = ([]) to initialize the mapping rather than
       using allocate_mapping().

       Note: at this point in time, `size' is  meaningless,  x  =
       allocate_mapping(200); is equivalent to x = ([ ]);
