NAME
       objects - return an array of all loaded objects

SYNOPSIS
       object *objects( string func, object ob );

DESCRIPTION
       An  array of every object loaded on the mud is returned by
       objects().  Note that if the system's maximum  array  size
       is  set  too  low,  objects()  will truncate its array, in
       which case it might not be too useful.

       If the optional `func' and `ob' parameters are given, then
       ob->func()  is  called with each loaded object as an argu-
       ment.  If the function returns nonzero, then  that  object
       is returned by objects(), otherwise it isn't.
